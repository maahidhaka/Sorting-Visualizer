Sorting algorithms are the heart of computer science and data manipulation. Sorting Visualizer brings these algorithms to life through a visually interactive tool, helping users understand and analyze the behavior of some of the most popular sorting techniques.

🚀 Features

✨ Visualized Algorithms

This tool supports the visualization of the following sorting algorithms:

Quick Sort

A highly efficient, divide-and-conquer algorithm with average-case time complexity of O(n log n).

Learn how partitions are created and observe recursive sorting in action.

Merge Sort

A stable and efficient algorithm with guaranteed time complexity of O(n log n).

Watch how the array is divided, conquered, and merged step-by-step.

Bubble Sort

A simple yet educational algorithm with time complexity of O(n^2) in the worst case.

See how adjacent elements "bubble" into place through multiple passes.

Selection Sort

A straightforward algorithm with time complexity of O(n^2).

Observe how the smallest element is repeatedly selected and moved to its correct position.

🖼️ Screenshots

Include GIFs or images of your visualizer in action to give users a glimpse of the experience.
